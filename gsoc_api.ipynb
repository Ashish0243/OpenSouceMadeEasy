I also plan to simulate real PostgreSQL activity to ensure all panels are receiving meaningful data and functioning correctly.

The policy ensures ABI...', 'description': 'PostgreSQL introduced Server API and ABI Stability Guidance to help extension authors understand compatibility expectations. The policy ensures ABI stability between minor releases (e.g., 17.0 to 17.1) but allows changes in major versions. Currently, committers rely on manual reviews to enforce this, which occasionally leads to unintended ABI changes. A recent example occurred in PostgreSQL 17.1, where an ABI-breaking change was shipped and later reversed in 17.2. This incident highlights the need for an automated process to catch such issues before release. To enforce ABI stability, this project will monitor PostgreSQL’s repository across branches, detecting any instability early. Since ABI changes depend on system architecture, OS, and compiler, the tool will be developed as an extension to PostgreSQL Build Farm, leveraging its infrastructure to handle diverse configurations. Git receive hooks are unsuitable as PostgreSQL does not allow them due to repository performance concerns. Instead, the build farm’s cron-based clients (animals) will store commit hashes locally and compare subsequent commits for ABI changes. The Libabigail suite (abidw, abidiff) will be used for ABI compliance checks, currently supporting GCC and Clang, with future expansion planned for other compilers. The system will generate ABI compliance reports for every commit, processed by the build farm server, which will be refactored to handle reports and update mailing logic to notify committers of breaking changes. This project will include the development of a Build Farm Client that generates ABI compliance reports per commit, a refactoring of the Build Farm Server to handle reports and update mailing logic, thorough testing to ensure stability before production deployment, and final deployment of the compliance checker by setting up the build farm client and server. This project will strengthen PostgreSQL’s ABI stability process, preventing unintended breakages and ensuring smoother updates.', 'student_name': 'Mankirat Singh', 'code_url': None, 'proposal_id': 'P1p7eg3T', 'project_url': 'https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/jFquLTUi'}, {'title': 'pgmoneta: WAL Filtering', 'short_description': 'pgmoneta is an open-source tool designed for PostgreSQL backup and recovery, with a strong focus on managing Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files critical...', 'description': 'pgmoneta is an open-source tool designed for PostgreSQL backup and recovery, with a strong focus on managing Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files critical for data integrity and point-in-time recovery. Current solutions like PITR force restoration to a pre-accident state, losing valid changes made afterward. This project aims to enhance pgmoneta by adding advanced WAL filtering capabilities for targeted recovery, allowing users to preserve recent valid data while excluding specific operations, such as accidental DELETE queries or changes to certain tables. The proposed solution involves developing pgmoneta-walfilter, a command-line tool integrated into pgmoneta.
